What's this mess about?

Basically this is just a place for me to dump some thoughts (sometimes in german). Most of it will be related to my job as sys-admin with a focus on endpoint management (mainly Windows, but also a bit of Linux - probably even MacOS).

I'll try to provide some (hopefully helpful) insights into operating system and software deployment using [Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-endpoint-manager), as well as about IT-security and data-privacy related topics. I'll also recap some stuff that I've done in my master programme at the [faculty of computer science @UNIVIE](https://informatik.univie.ac.at/).

I'll share infos about [unattended installations](/unattend) of various applications, because sometimes it can be quite cumbersome to find the right parameters. I also want to give some insight into [projects](/projects) I'm doing at home in my spare time. This will include building a homelab around Windows AD, as well as certain game development and data science related programming projects.

This is actually my second attempt to start a blog, but the first one in this decade. Let's see if I can keep this up & running until the next leap day in 2024. Don't expect too sophisticated stuff here. If someone else has already written about something in great detail (and if I know about it), I'll probably just put a link to this person's site.

If you really want to, you can also follow me at Mastodon or Twitter - although don't get your hopes up, I'm mostly re-tweeting.
