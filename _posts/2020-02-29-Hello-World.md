What's this mess about?

Basically this is just a place for me to dump some thoughts (sometimes in german). Most of it will be related to my job as sys-admin with a focus on endpoint management (mainly Windows, but also a bit of Linux - probably even MacOS). 

I'll try to provide some (hopefully helpful) insights into operating system and software deployment using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM), as well as about IT-security and data-privacy related topics. I'll also recap some stuff that I've done in my master programme at the faculty of computer science @UNIVIE. Maybe I'll give some insight into projects I'm doing at home in my spare time.

This is actually my second attempt to start a blog, but the first one in this decade (ok, don't get into a fight if a new decade has already started). Let's see if I can keep this up & running until the next leap day in 2024.

Don't expect too sophisticated stuff here. If someone else has already written about something in great detail (and if I know about it), I'll probably just put a link to this person's site.
If you really want to, you can also follow me at Mastodon or Twitter - although don't get your hopes up, I'm mostly re-tweeting.
