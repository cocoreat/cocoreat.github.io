# This is the data for my blog

The foundation is based on [Tom Preston-Werner's personal blog](http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/), which is also 
hosted here at Github.

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.
